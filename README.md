- 👋 Hi, I’m @bkane53
- 👀 I’m interested in controlling flight surfaces (fins) on high power rockets in response to input from onboard inertial measurement (combinations of accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others having experience with inertial measurement units (IMU) capable of withstanding high g-forces
- 📫 You can reach me via email:  bkanemobile@gmail.com.
